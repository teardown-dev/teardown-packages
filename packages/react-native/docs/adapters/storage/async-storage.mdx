title: AsyncStorageAdapter
description: Storage adapter using @react-native-async-storage/async-storage.
---

The `AsyncStorageAdapter` uses the community AsyncStorage library for persistent storage with broad platform compatibility.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
# or
bun add @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

For Expo:
```bash
npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { TeardownCore } from '@teardown/react-native';
import { DeviceInfoAdapter } from '@teardown/react-native/adapters/device-info';
import { AsyncStorageAdapter } from '@teardown/react-native/adapters/async-storage';

export const teardown = new TeardownCore({
  org_id: 'your-org-id',
  project_id: 'your-project-id',
  api_key: 'your-api-key',
  storageAdapter: new AsyncStorageAdapter(),
  deviceAdapter: new DeviceInfoAdapter(),
});
```

## Import Path

```typescript
import { AsyncStorageAdapter } from '@teardown/react-native/adapters/async-storage';
```

## When to Use

- Web support needed
- Existing AsyncStorage setup in your app
- Simpler debugging (plain text storage)
- Expo Go compatibility (no dev build needed)

## Trade-offs

### Pros
- Broader platform support (iOS, Android, Web)
- Works in Expo Go without dev build
- Plain text storage (easier debugging)
- Well-established, stable API

### Cons
- Asynchronous API (slightly slower)
- No built-in encryption
- Larger bundle size than MMKV

## How It Works

AsyncStorage provides a key-value storage API:

1. The adapter wraps AsyncStorage with a synchronous-like interface
2. Uses `preload()` to hydrate data into memory at startup
3. Writes are persisted asynchronously

## Requirements

- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` >= 1.17.0
- React Native >= 0.60

## Platform Notes

### iOS
- Data stored in NSUserDefaults (small data) or files (large data)
- Not encrypted by default

### Android
- Data stored in SQLite database
- Not encrypted by default

### Web
- Uses localStorage
- Size limited (~5MB)

## Encryption Note

AsyncStorage does not encrypt data by default. For sensitive data, consider:
- Using MMKV instead (encrypted by default)
- Encrypting values before storage
- Using a separate encrypted storage for secrets
