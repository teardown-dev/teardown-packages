title: MMKVStorageAdapter
description: Fast, encrypted storage adapter using react-native-mmkv.
---

The `MMKVStorageAdapter` uses MMKV for high-performance, encrypted storage. **Recommended for most apps.**

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-native-mmkv
# or
bun add react-native-mmkv
```

For iOS, run pod install:
```bash
cd ios && pod install
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { TeardownCore } from '@teardown/react-native';
import { ExpoDeviceAdapter } from '@teardown/react-native/adapters/expo';
import { MMKVStorageAdapter } from '@teardown/react-native/adapters/mmkv';

export const teardown = new TeardownCore({
  org_id: 'your-org-id',
  project_id: 'your-project-id',
  api_key: 'your-api-key',
  storageAdapter: new MMKVStorageAdapter(),
  deviceAdapter: new ExpoDeviceAdapter(),
});
```

## Import Path

```typescript
import { MMKVStorageAdapter } from '@teardown/react-native/adapters/mmkv';
```

## Benefits

- **Synchronous** - No async/await needed for reads/writes
- **Encrypted** - Data encrypted by default
- **Fast** - Memory-mapped for optimal performance
- **Small** - Minimal bundle size impact
- **Reliable** - Used by WeChat with 1B+ users

## How It Works

MMKV uses memory-mapped files for storage:

1. Data is written to memory
2. OS flushes to disk asynchronously
3. Reads are instant (from memory)
4. Crash-safe with journaling

## Requirements

- `react-native-mmkv` >= 2.0.0
- React Native >= 0.71

## Platform Notes

### iOS
- Requires `pod install`
- Data stored in app's sandboxed Documents directory
- Encrypted with iOS Keychain

### Android
- Works out of the box
- Data stored in app's private directory
- Encrypted with Android KeyStore

## Expo Compatibility

For Expo managed workflow, you need a development build:

```bash
npx expo install react-native-mmkv
npx expo prebuild
```

Or use EAS Build for production.
